# Enjoy-the-outdoors
A simple website made for users to search for national parks in different states and also get info about mountains

I used a css framework called "water css" for my styling, I know I should've used some bootstrap but I had liked the minimal look of the site and i didnt have time to do all the bootstrap styling

The favourite part of my website, the home page. I randomly picked the name "Enchanted Eden" just for a placeholder name but after some positive feedback from some friends about the name being nice I kept it.
The background image is the Grand Prismatic Spring that lives in Yellowstone. My idea for this image choice was that the website is about national parks and Yellowstone is a national park that I have also been to and the Grand Prismatic Spring was my favourite part of being at the park and hiking around.

# National Parks Page

When you click on the national parks button on the home page it takes you to the page where users can search for a national park via park location or park type

When the "by location" radio button is clicked on, it will list all the states where a park could possibly exist. Once you click on a state you get greeted with:

There will be a striped table with all the national parks of that state. Name, address, a working site link and more can be found on these tables for each park

If the user wants to search for a park by a park type they can use this drop down and look for a park that will suit them perfectly

For my mountain information page, users can get informations about the many mountains in the United States. To keep with consistency I had my page look pretty much like my National Parks page.

# Most interesting code I wrote
This has been an issue i've been struggling with javascript which is displaying the objects in my tables using javascript. For me that would be the most interesting code I wrote since it took me so long to understand and I still dont think I fully get the hang of how it works so thats definitely something i'm also proud of working on since I mainly coded it on my own with only asking for minimal help on the side

# Final thoughts
This was definitely a tough project, I started off strong and with a lot of confidence but as I got to the more complicated portions, I slowly began feeling like I was not doing as well as my peers, especially as I was trying to figure out a lot of things on my own for an extra challenge and just also out of stubborness of not wanting help from others. Im proud of how my page came out but I couldve definitely did this all a lot better for a more professional and official look.
